I'm a dedicated and ambitious AI researcher and software developer with a strong background in data science, computer engineering, and domain adaptation for medical imaging. Currently, I'm completing a double degree master's program in Data Science at **EURECOM** in France and **Politecnico di Torino** in Italy, where I'm delving deep into machine learning and artificial intelligence.  

## üî¨ Current Interests
- **Domain Generalization**: Researching robust methods to improve domain adaptation, particularly in **multi-source medical imaging** through techniques like artifact injection for enhanced segmentation across varied domains.
- **Multi-Channel Variational Autoencoders**: Designing architectures to learn segmentation-critical features from diverse medical image modalities, enabling better cross-modal learning and feature extraction.

## üíº Experience
- **AI Research Internship at Inria** (Sophia Antipolis, France): I'm exploring domain generalization methods for medical images and developing advanced multi-channel autoencoders.
- **Web Application Development at Orbyta** (Torino, Italy): Developed web applications using **React** and created a scratch-and-win game using **Phaser.js**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, C++
- **Technologies**: Git, Linux, React
- **AI & ML**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning basics, Variational Inference
- **Other Skills**: Database management, advanced programming, and system architecture

## üöÄ Projects
Here are a few of the projects I‚Äôm proud to share:
- **[Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/g-orl/AnomalyDetection)**: Analyzing anomalous sounds in industrial environments to prevent malfunctions using the **ToyADMOS** and **MIMII** datasets.
- **[JamParty](https://github.com/g-orl/JamParty)**: A mobile application for seamless group music sharing in social events.
- **[OS161](https://github.com/g-orl/c2-os161)**: Built core system calls to support multiprocessing in OS161, including `execv` and `dup2`.
